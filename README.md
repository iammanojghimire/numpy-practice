## Introduction
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is an open source library written in `c++`, It is the fundamental package for `scientific computing with python`.

Numpy provides:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
- incredible library to perform mathematical and statical operations

Numpy is fast and memory efficiency.In fact, `Tensorflow` and `scikit learn` 
used Numpy array to compute the matrix multiplication in the back end.
